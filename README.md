## Mission & Vision

Imagine a world where people can easily find and understand what they need. 

The nonprofit World IA Day provides the foundation for learning about information architecture, a discipline devoted to the understanding of how information is structured and understood. 

We host World IA Day, the one day a year the community gets together for a global conference, curated and organized by volunteers around the world. We have plans to conduct collaborative research and mentoring projects to address change in culture and society.

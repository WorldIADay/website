# Committees
WIAD offers multiple ways for people to contribute at all levels of the organization.

At the local level, volunteers organize World IA Day events. At the global level, volunteers have direct contribution through the various committees, task forces, and mentorship projects.

## What are committees?
Committees may be:
- permanent -- e.g. Events. Committees tend to be created by those with high context but low capacity for action (such as officers or directors) as committee chairs and recruit contributors who are able to volunteer/act as stewards.
- temporary -- "task force" committees for certain purpose- may be subcommittees. For instance, a task force may be created to handle a certain/specific Code of Conduct incident

Chair commitments last about a year with the ability to advance to the Board.
Get involved and join one of the working committees.

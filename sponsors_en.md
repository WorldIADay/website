# Sponsor World IA Day
We're open to building custom partnerships with the right people—if you have an idea, let us know!
Be a part of a global gathering for information architecture. World IA Day has provided accessible IA education to over 13,000 participants in more than 12 languages since 2012.

Let's build communities together.

Our focus is on building local communities of practice within a global network. We recognize that our best chance at reaching our common goals is to foster participation from anyone who may benefit from a better understanding of Information Architecture. To this end, we hold an open-door policy that encourages our greater community to get involved. We hold open planning meetings that anyone may attend, get local businesses involved through targeted event sponsorship, and hold each other accountable for maintaining our spirit of inclusivity.

## We need global partners and sponsors.
Whether your organization can contribute an in-kind service or a financial donation, your support will make a huge difference.
Here are a few reasons to contribute:

- It is global and exposure is massive. In 2020 we expect to hold celebrations in 60+ locations across 29 countries within 6 continents.
- It draws a huge audience. More than 6000 participants around the world in 2016, a 33% growth from the year prior.
- Attendees and participants come from many disciplines. They include information architects, content strategists, designers, developers, entrepreneurs, academic staff, executives, and students.
- It’s the biggest event in our industry. Leaders from many disciplines come together to contribute their time & content.

By contributing, you will help to grow global communities of people able to practice and teach information architecture.

Each of our basic sponsorship packages offer something special to the WIAD community and gives you the opportunities to get involved with the community.
